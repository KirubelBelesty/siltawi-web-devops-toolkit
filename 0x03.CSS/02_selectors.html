    <p>CSS selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style in CSS. They are used to tell the
      browser which HTML elements should be applied to the CSS property values inside the rule.</p>
    <ul>

      <li>

        Simple selectors select elements based on their name, id, or class. For example, the selector h1 will select all
        <h1> elements on the page.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combinator selectors combine simple selectors to select elements based on their relationship to each other. For
        example, the selector h1 + p will select all <p> elements that are immediately preceded by an
        <h1> element.

      </li>
      <li>

        Pseudo-class selectors select elements based on their state or condition. For example, the selector a:hover will
        select all <a> elements that are currently being hovered over by the mouse.
      </li>
      <li>

        Pseudo-elements selectors select and style a part of an element. For example, the selector ::after will select
        the element's after pseudo-element, which is a special element that is inserted after the element in the DOM.
      </li>
      <li>

        Attribute selectors select elements based on their attributes. For example, the selector a[href] will select all
        <a> elements that have a href attribute.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="about">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      CSS selectors can be combined to create complex selectors that select multiple elements or elements with specific
      properties. For example, the selector h1.my-class:hover will select all
    <h1> elements that have the my-class class and are currently being hovered over by the mouse.

      CSS selectors are an essential part of CSS, and they allow you to precisely control which elements are styled by
      your CSS rules. By understanding how CSS selectors work, you can create more powerful and flexible CSS styles.
